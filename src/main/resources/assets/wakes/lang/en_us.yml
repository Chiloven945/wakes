        description:
            wave_propagation_factor: >
                The impact a pixels has on its neighboring pixels inside the wakes
            wave_decay_factor: >
                Specifies how much of a pixels value is left after each tick. (Logarithmic scale)
            initial_wave_strengths: >
                The strength a source starts with to produce a wake.
            splash_plane.cap_velocity: >
                The velocity at which the maximum size of the splash plane is reached
            spawning_rules: >
                Specifies which effect(s) a source (player, mob, etc) can produce.
            wake_resolution: >
                The pixel resolution of the wakes. Good for adjusting the wakes to better visually fit some resource packs.

            use_water_blending: >
                Should the wake's colors blend with the water's colors?
            use_9_point_stencil: >
                Old debug option. Can look good with 'subtle' wake style.
